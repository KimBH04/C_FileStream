The last thing I remember was
Our call back in January
But nothing comes up afterwards
Been a while I've seen you onscreen
Cause I have been on DND
Our message count is less than three when
I said that you're free to talk to me
I got used to having you around
But in the end it's neither of our faults
Cause back then I
Listened to your voice 24/7
We were dancing through it all
Dancing through it
Although I do miss the times we've spent together
You're so 2020
You're just like pop music
Your icon on the VC
It highlighted my virtual space
Now I only see you on my feed
Means we both really went our ways
Cause I have been on DND
Our message count is less than three when
I said that you're free to talk to me
I got used to having you around
But in the end it's neither of our faults
Cause back then I
Listened to your voice 24/7
We were dancing through it all
Dancing through it
Although I do miss the times we've spent together
You're so 2020
You're just like pop music
Just like songs in the radio
Every memory will come and go
Sometimes I wonder if I'm to blame
That those wistful days are now long gone
Back then you listened to my voice 24/7
(We were dancing through it all, dancing through it all)
Although I do miss the times we've spent together
I'm so 2020
Back then I
Listened to your voice 24/7
We were dancing through it all
Dancing through it
Although I do miss the times we've spent together
You're so 2020
You're just like pop music
Just like, just like pop music
Just like, just like pop music
Just like, just like pop music
You're just like pop music
Just like, just like pop music
Just like, just like pop music
Just like, just like pop music
You're just like pop music
You're just like pop music
